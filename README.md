# Bewa's Epic Roblox Studio Plugins
Uses module scripts from [Roblox/StudioWidgets](https://github.com/Roblox/StudioWidgets).

## TC2 Boss Catalog Inserter
Takes the ID of a catalog item and inserts it into the selected boss.

Supports accessories, classic clothing and dynamic heads.\
Supports undo and redo (pretty sure).

USAGE:\
When used with accessories, it just places them inside the character.\
With classic clothing (shirts and pants), it replaces the existing ones inside the character.\
With dynamic heads, it creates an accessory and sets the character's head transparency to 1.\
Make sure to use the ID of the dynamic head itself, not the ID of the bundle it's in (Scroll down on the bundle page to see included items).
