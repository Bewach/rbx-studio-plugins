## Bewa's Boss Tools
[Download](https://github.com/Bewach/rbx-studio-plugins/releases/download/bewas-boss-tools/Bewas.Boss.Tools.rbxmx)

Behold, my magnum opus:

Currently has 2 features:
1. Takes the ID of a catalog item and inserts it into the selected boss.

Supports accessories, classic clothing and dynamic heads (also regular faces and decals I guess).
Supports undo and redo.

USAGE:
When used with accessories, it just places them inside the character.
With classic clothing (shirts and pants), it replaces the existing ones inside the character.
With dynamic heads, it creates an accessory and sets the character's head transparency to 1.
With decals, it just places them inside the head.

2. Takes the shirt ID from the selected boss and inserts it into its arms, creating the necessary components if they don't exist. Also supports undo and redo.


Uses the [Iris](https://github.com/SirMallard/Iris) GUI library (it's awesome).
